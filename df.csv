GENERAL \n\nQuestions regarding any aspect of the project are to be addressed to and answered only by the Departmental Representative (or his designate) or the Contracting Authority. \n\nAny information received other than from the Departmental Representative (or his designate) or the Contracting Authority will be disregarded when awarding the contract and during construction. \n\nFirms intending to submit tenders on this project should obtain tender documents through the Buyandsell.gc.ca TMA services provider. Addenda, when issued, will be available from the Buyandsell.gc.ca TMA service provider. Firms that elect to base their bids on tender documents obtained from other sources do so at their own risk and will be solely responsible to inform the tender calling authority of their intention to bid. Tender packages are not available for distribution on the actual day of tender closing.  \n\n2.	MANDATORY SITE VISIT \n\nIt is mandatory that the bidder attends one of the site visits at the designated date and time.\nAt least one representative from proponents that intend to bid must attend.\n\nThe site visits will be held on June 26th and June 27th 2024 at 9:30am.  Meet Nick Becker at 2320 Lester Road, Building U89, Main Entrance, Ottawa, ON. Bidders who, for any reason, cannot attend at the specified date and time will not be given an alternative appointment to view the site and their tenders, therefore, will be considered as non-responsive.  NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE.\n\nAs proof of attendance, at the site visit, the Contracting Authority will have an Attendance Form which MUST be signed by the bidder’s representative.  It is the responsibility of all bidders to ensure they have signed the Mandatory Site Visit Attendance form prior to leaving the site.  Proposals submitted by bidders who have not attended the site visit or failed to sign the Attendance Form will be deemed non-responsive.\n\n3.

CSC wishes to allow other suppliers to signal their interest in providing these goods and services, by submitting a statement of capabilities.CSC will not be awarding a contract as a result of this notice. CSC will be establishing a list of potential suppliers for the required goods and services. If another supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in this notice, on or before the closing date and time stated in this notice, CSC will include the supplier in the list of potential suppliers.1.0 Definition of the requirement:1.1 BackgroundThe Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) is the federal government agency responsible for administering court-imposed sentences of a term of two years or more. CSC is responsible for managing institutions of various security levels and supervising offenders under conditional release in the community. CSC is responsible for approximately 23,000 offenders, of which 15,000 are in federal custody and 8,000 are supervised in the community.When inmates arrive at an institution, they are provided with essential items and can have personal items sent in from the community during a specific time period at the beginning of their sentence. After this period, and throughout their sentence, inmates may purchase other items for personal use, as long as they are consistent with CSC internal directives, do not undermine rehabilitation efforts, do not pose a security or safety concern, and finally do not exceed the allowable property value for each inmate. Inmates purchase a variety of items over the course of their sentence. The largest volume of purchases is for electronics and associated items, followed by clothing and footwear. All items are purchased using Inmate funds and are at zero cost to Canada (CSC).In May 2012, the Economic Action Plan introduced a new process for inmate purchasing with the aim of increasing offender accountability, standardizing the approach to inmate purchasing across Canada, and reducing the amount of time staff would spend on managing transactions and purchasing items.1.2 Objectives:CSC is seeking to establish a business account agreement with an e-commerce company for the provision of inmate personal property within CSC’s institutions. This iniative aims to increase efficiencies and enhance institutional safety for inmates. CSC has developed a list of items that it will make available for purchase to inmates referenced in Attachment 1.CSC’s objective is to ensure that the same items are available to all inmates, at standardized costs, including delivery, regardless of the institution’s location.1.3 Tasks and Deliverables:The tasks and deliverables the e-commerce provider must complete include the following:Provide a free centralized Business Account which allows authorized CSC personnel to order approved items via an e-commerce platform.

Should printed material be required, double sided printing in black and white format is the default unless otherwise specified by the Project Authority.b. The e-commerce provider must ensure printed material is on paper with a minimum recycled content of 30% and/or certified as originating from a sustainably managed forest.c.

This IT infrastructure will enable commanders across the CAF to exercise Command and Control (C2), including at deployed headquarters, using the latest available technologies to provide optimal support capabilities. \n\nThe DND/CAF will deliver this new capability through the Information Technology Infrastructure in Support of Command and Control (ITI in Sp of C2) Project, which will, among other things, strive to leverage industry capabilities and efficiencies to deliver services to the maximum extent possible. \n\nNature of this Request for Information:\nThis RFI is neither a call for tender nor a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No agreement or contract will be entered into based on this RFI. The issuance of this RFI is not to be considered in any way a commitment by the Government of Canada or as authority to potential respondents to undertake any work that could be charged to Canada. This RFI is not to be considered as a commitment to issue a subsequent solicitation or award contract(s) for the work described herein.\n\nAlthough the information collected may be provided as commercial-in-confidence (and, if identified as such, will be treated accordingly by Canada), Canada may use the information to assist in drafting performance specifications (which are subject to change) and for budgetary purposes.\n\nRespondents are encouraged to identify, in the information they share with Canada, any information that they feel is proprietary, third party or personal information. All responses to this RFI will be held by PWGSC on a confidential basis (subject to applicable legislation) and remain the property of PWGSC once they have been received.\n\nRespondents are asked to identify if their response, or any part of their response, is subject to the Controlled Goods Regulations.\nRespondents must submit responses or questions containing classified information in accordance with the instructions in the RFI.\n\nRespondents will not be reimbursed for any cost incurred by participating in this RFI.\n\nThe RFI closing date published herein is not the deadline for comments or input. Comments and input will be accepted any time up to the time when/if a follow-on solicitation is published.\n\nNational Security Exception (NSE) Notice:\nAll aspects of this RFI and any resulting solicitation or contract are subject to the national security exception and are, therefore, excluded from all of the obligations of the trade agreements.\n\nSecurity Requirement:\nThere is a security requirement associated with this RFI.\n\nEnquiries\nUnless otherwise specified in the RFI, all enquiries and other communications related to this RFI shall be directed exclusively to the PWGSC Contracting Authority.

The integrated CD-DAR capability must provide reliable contextual analysis to support DND/CAF decisions and actions within designated Command Network (Comd-Net) Extensions and Interfaces, and deployable Defence Wide Area Network (DWAN) systems. Ultimately, the CD-DAR capability will enable the CAF Cyber Force to defend the CAF’s freedom of action and interests in cyberspace in support of CAF missions and operations.

Background Information:\n\nThe WESM project will modernize the Canadian Army (CA) WES training system to enable individual and collective training in order to deliver combat effective CA units and formations. \nThe WES capability was acquired by the CA to address the deficiency in simulating realistic weapon effects during force-on-force field training exercises. The WES system provides soldiers the opportunity to train in the way that they would fight, utilizing actual weapons and vehicle platforms as they would be used in theatre and on deployments.  This capability provides data and products for effective after-action reviews to enhance the commanders’ ability to train and evaluate the readiness of their troops in both an urban and rural training environment. There are four (4) instrumented static sites (with fixed exercise control center) located in Wainwright, Alberta, Gagetown, New Brunswick,  Petawawa, Ontario and Valcartier, Quebec in addition to a mobile capability which can be used anywhere within Canada, including thetwo (2) non-instrumented sites, one located in Edmonton, Alberta and the other in Shilo, Manitoba. The intent of this project is to modernize the existing WES capability potentially addressing: equipment obsolescence; updated operational requirements; and advancements in technology and international standards (such as those being developed under UCATT). The intent of this RFI is to seek information from industry; thereby allowing the Government of Canada to better define the options for the modernization of the Canadian WES System.\n\n3.

Stabilizing the Government of Canada’s (GoC) current pay system (Phoenix) remains a top priority and continues to be carried out by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) integrated team.  While recent information indicates the current pay system is showing some signs of stabilizing, a longer-term, sustainable, end-to-end solution needs to be explored for an HR and pay solution.\n\nAs outlined in Budget 2018, in addition to Stabilizing Phoenix, the GoC is committing to the next steps in addressing the ongoing challenges of the Phoenix pay system, including its intention to move to a next generation solution; one that will be better aligned with the complexity of the federal government’s HR and pay structure.  The Phoenix issues have shown that HR and pay are mutually dependent and don't exist in isolation.  The next generation solution may therefore also support the full hire-to-retire employee lifecycle, enabling the GoC to better attract, pay, retain and nurture its employees.  This solution may cover aspects such as: recruitment, training, performance management and other HR processes and systems, and interdependencies with pay, and any other downstream systems like pension and receiver general.\n\nThe GoC is committed to exploring all options, and will be working with experts, unions, public servants, and technology providers to address the current pay challenges as well as define the way forward.  In particular, we are committed to working in partnership with our bargaining agents and system users at the centre of this process.  The GoC will consider the lessons learned and best practices from the implementation of large-scale initiatives from other jurisdictions.  Stabilization efforts are absolutely critical and will continue as the GoC works towards options for this Next Generation HR and pay solution.\n\nThe following information therefore relates to two distinct projects currently identified as priorities for the GoC:\n\n1. Stabilization of the Phoenix pay system and related pay activities -led by PSPC, through collaboration with the integrated team;\n2. Next Generation HR and pay solution (people, technology, and processes) - led by TBS on behalf of the GoC. \n\n\nA. Nature of Requirement\n \nThe GoC is calling on private sector vendors to provide information and potential solutions to a variety of Enterprise-wide business challenges and needs associated with both stabilization and a Next Generation HR and Pay solution.\n\nThis Notice:\n\n• Communicates that the GoC may establish pre-qualified lists of suppliers to address HR and Pay challenges; and\n• Identifies categories for which the GoC may be seeking information and potential solution proposals.\n\nThe following describes areas of work that the GoC will be seeking information and proposals.  This list may evolve with amendments, additions, or deletions.\n\n1) Stabilization: \n\na. Lowering the Queue/Backlog: The GoC is seeking innovative approaches to processing outstanding pay-related tickets in order to accelerate the close-rate.\n\nb. Training: The GoC is seeking training solutions to rapidly develop and deploy new training materials, deliver training products, and measure the effectiveness of the training. The solution should have the ability to assess how the training materials contribute to improved user productivity. \n\nc. Automation of Pay Centre Processes: Serving over 200,000 clients, the Pay Centre in Miramichi receives approximately 1.3 million requests for service annually.  Many of these requests result in compensation agents at the Pay Centre having to perform some level of manual processing to complete the transaction. The GoC is seeking innovative approaches and solutions to automate some of these manual transactions, which can also be extended to pay processing in other Departments and Agencies.\n\nd. Improving User Experience: A number of studies have identified that the usability of pay systems and processes needs to improve. Users, and particularly employees and managers, are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and frustration because interactions related to pay are spread across multiple channels, do not always provide requested information and are not sufficiently responsive. Canada is seeking innovative approaches to improve the user experience.\n\ne. Automation of System User Access Management: Current user-access management processes are paper-based causing delays to employee’s access to HR and Pay systems.  The GoC is seeking assistance to automate these processes in the current Phoenix pay system, while retaining necessary controls.\n\nf. HR Processes: The design of the Phoenix system requires that data be fed from HR systems into the Phoenix system or directly entered into Phoenix by compensation advisors. The various HR Systems interfacing with the Phoenix Pay System have different architectures and different front end system edits which have a direct influence on the quality of the HR data being transmitted to Phoenix and ultimately on the pay cheque of employees. Over the course of the last two years while operating the new Phoenix payroll system and the new consolidated compensation process operation, the Government of Canada has identified HR Process Transformation as an area that requires strengthening in order to stabilize and subsequently optimize its HR-to-Pay process. Canada is seeking innovative approaches to effectively and efficiently perform HR functions that have led to positive downstream payroll implications and will directly contribute to system stabilization.  \n \n2) Next Generation HR and Pay Solution:\n\na. Discovery and Design Thinking: The GoC continues to learn and adopt leading human-centered design & service design best practices that can shape the vision and inform decisions across all aspects of the project (people, technology, processes).  The GoC may seek expert assistance in conducting user research and engaging GoC employees, HR practitioners, compensation advisors and/or unions to further understand who the users are, what are their goals and expectations, and how the new service should meet those needs.\n\nb. Digital Business Optimization and Architecture: As employee and citizen expectations rise and businesses deliver digital-based and better services across all industry sectors, the GoC recognizes the need to rethink the way it works. The GoC may seek expert assistance in conducting an end-to-end review of business capabilities, business outcomes, business requirements and business processes, potentially resulting in improvements to service models and pay operations, improved training, reporting, interactions, etc. \n\nc. Innovative technology solutions: As digital concepts are releasing more personalized employee, supplier, and partner experiences through the use of mobility, self-service, cloud, in-memory databases, embedded analytics, etc., GoC employees expect and demand that innovation be also reflected in their interactions with government so that GoC employees can take full advantage.  Consequently, the GoC may seek expert assistance to evaluate and fully utilize innovative solutions, industry best practices and technological advancements are embedded into the GoC’s future.\n\nd. Change Management: The GoC recognizes that change management should be a priority throughout the life of any high risk, complex transformation initiative and is fundamental to ensure business outcomes are met. The GoC may seek expert assistance to ensure individuals, teams, and organizations are prepared and supported to successfully execute the organizational change.\n\ne. Program Management & Capacity: The GoC recognizes that oversight and strategic direction is critical to ensure the desired outcomes are reached and benefits realized. The GoC may seek a strategic partnership(s) to supplement the Next Generation Project team’s capacity to plan for transformation to digital services and platforms based on their understanding of industry best practices, methodologies, implementation strategies, etc. Any strategic partner(s) would not be allowed to bid on the future business, technology, or implementation services related to any Next Generation HR and Pay solution.\n\nIn all applicable areas above, the GoC requires all solutions to be accessible by default, include security and privacy by design, and leverage the use of cloud services first (in alignment with the Policy on Management of IT, secured in accordance with the Direction on the Secure Use of Commercial Cloud Services).\n\nPlease note GoC pay stabilization efforts have been ongoing since 2016, and GoC Next Generation HR and Pay solution efforts started earlier in 2018.  Therefore some private sector vendors have already been engaged and some standing procurement vehicles are already in place, which have helped the GoC begin work in some of the categories highlighted above.  Existing vehicles will continue to be leveraged as appropriate, and any information gathered to date will serve as foundational as the GoC looks to address, as required, all of the areas outlined in this notice.\n\nB. Context\n\nThe Pay Modernization Project replaced the Regional Pay System with a PeopleSoft based payroll system, an application that eventually came to be called Phoenix.  Since pay crisis emerged in spring 2016, it has been obvious that the outcomes have been unacceptable for both the Government and its employees.\n\nThe Pay Consolidation Project consolidated the compensation function, which resided within each GoC department and agency, under PSPC and included the location in Miramichi, New Brunswick.  Today, 44 departments representing approximately 200,000 civil servants are provided with compensation services based out of the Miramichi Pay Centre. \n\nThe GoC has worked with its own subject matter experts and suppliers alike to deploy improvements to ensure employees are paid accurately and on time. \n\nSince pay crisis emerged in spring 2016, the on-going difficulties with the implementation of the pay system triggered a decision, as documented in Budget 2018, to begin investigating the development of the next generation of the federal government’s HR and pay systems. \n\nC. Procurement Framework \n\nAs part of its effort to streamline the procurement process and improve business outcomes, with a focus on agility and dialogue with interested vendors, the GoC plans to engage industry as follows.\n\n1. The GoC recognizes the diversity of industry, which may range from vertically integrated vendors, start-ups, and long established corporate entities. \n2. The purpose of the proposed procurement is to allow the Government of Canada, as an enterprise, to rapidly access, pre-qualified suppliers that can provide innovative solutions to a variety of business challenges  Canada may put forth relating to all aspects of the HR-to-Pay environment and its related services.\n3. Any proposed procurement will be processed through the PSPC or TBS procurement authority potentially using a wide range of procurement tools.\n4. As an initial step, the GoC anticipates sharing more information on the problem to be solved and solicit information from industry with the intention of using the feedback to determine how to best proceed and use the various procurement options the GoC has at its disposal.  \n5. The GoC will work with suppliers in a collaborative fashion to the greatest extent possible and an iterative approach may be used to incorporate feedback from both stakeholders and industry. As such, the GoC also intends to qualify firms in various workstreams which would subsequently be invited to compete either in an expedited way or through an agile iterative approach.\n6. As part of the collaborative process, suppliers must be prepared to offer a sandbox environment to the GoC at no charge to demonstrate functionality and facilitate evaluation.\n \n\n7. The GoC may employ a variety of procurement tools to solicit industry response to this Notice.  Canada anticipates that it may use Requests for Information (RFI), Letters of Interest (LOI), Invitations to Qualify (ITQ), Requests for Proposals (RFP), Requests for Supply Arrangement (RFSA) and\or other methods to meet its needs.\n8. Suppliers should be aware that initiating a business solution in response to a procurement request may not result in the solution being selected for implementation.\n9. The GoC remains open to solutions put forth both internally by its own subject matter experts and externally from innovators that may complement work already undertaken or planned.\n\nD. Approach and Timelines \n\nAs part of its effort to streamline the procurement process and reduce dwell times along the procurement continuum with a focus on agility and dialogues with interested vendors, the GoC plans to engage industry as follows:\n\n1. Start publishing RFIs on www.buyandsell.gc.ca in September 2018, outlining specific business problems and to establish lists of qualified suppliers to address HR-to-Pay issues. \n2. Industry consultation(s) as required (industry day and/or one-on-one meetings).\n3. Establish a list of pre-qualified suppliers via RFSA or ITQ or other processes such as an iterative agile procurement (fall 2018).\n4. Compete amongst pre-qualified suppliers (if required) (starting fall 2018).\n5. Award contract(s) as deemed appropriate.\n6. Periodic refresh of qualified supplier lists and/or refresh the list of workstreams.\n\nThe exact approach and timelines may vary per workstream (business challenge and service requested).\n\n*To receive an email notification for new amendments, select the email notification service icon   and fill out the subscription form on the Page of Notice. \n\nE.

The aim of the GHG Disclosure Standard is to induce suppliers to measure and disclose their GHG emissions and adopt a science-based target to reduce GHGs in line with the Paris Agreement. As per section 3.2.1 of the GHG Disclosure Standard, organizations can participate in the Net-Zero Challenge or an equivalent initiative or standard to meet the requirement. The Net-Zero Challenge is a Government of Canada initiative that encourages businesses to develop and implement credible and effective plans to transition their facilities and operations to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n \nECCC intends to apply the same requirements to procurement contracts with costs of $100,000 to $3.75 million for services, including applicable taxes, and of $25,000 to $750,000 for goods, including applicable taxes, in addition to requirements with costs above $25 million. The aim of this proposal is to encourage further emissions reductions and net-zero planning in Canada.\n \nThe objectives of this RFI are to:\nRequest detailed information and feedback from suppliers.\nDetermine the capability of suppliers to satisfy a future requirement to adhere to the GHG Disclosure Standard for ECCC procurement services contracts of $100,000 to $3.75 million, including applicable taxes.\nDetermine the capability of suppliers to satisfy a future requirement to adhere to the GHG Disclosure Standard for ECCC procurement goods contracts of $25,000 to $750,000, including applicable taxes.\nAllow stakeholders to comment on a potential path forward.\n \nRespondents are requested to provide answers to the questions in Part 3 of this RFI (see section on Questions to Suppliers). \nStandard on the Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Setting of Reduction Targets- Canada.ca"

An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  An SA is not a contract for the provision of goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a supply arrangement alone.  The intent of a supply arrangement is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations."

LRIT regulations [MSC.202 (81)] apply to all passenger ships, including high-speed crafts engaged on international voyages, cargo ships, mobile offshore drilling units and vessels 300 gross tonnages and above.\nThe LRIT system, over the past four years, has allowed Canada to enhance its maritime security via improved Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The goal of LRIT is to implement a maritime security system that will enhance Canada’s ability to track Canadian SOLAS Vessels, identify foreign SOLAS-class vessels that are transiting within Canadian coastal waters out to 1,000 Nautical Miles (NM) and for vessels who have intended to enter Canadian port.\nAn active and accurate LRIT system also has clear safety benefits, most notably for maritime Search and Rescue (SAR). Accurate information on the location of the ship in distress as well as ships in the vicinity that could lend assistance will save valuable response time to affect a timely rescue.      \nThe goal of the LRIT system is to implement a maritime security initiative sponsored by the Federal Government of Canada that will enhance Canada’s ability to track vessels outside of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) Very High Frequency (VHF) range that are transiting within 1,000NM off Canada’s coastlines or for vessels that have declared their intention to enter a Canadian port. This initiative is clear in outlining the importance of the LRIT project with regards to improving Canadian maritime domain awareness for purposes of enhanced maritime security.\nConsequently, LRIT appears under Chapter V of the International Convention for the SOLAS Conventions, and SAR scenarios are built into LRIT standards and specifications.  The use of LRIT for other safety and marine environmental protection purposes was approved at the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting in October 2007.\nThe LRIT Service Project is a National Project which includes the following: \na.  	The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) LRIT National Data Centre (NDC) Service (this procurement); and\nb.  	The international LRIT System as mandated by the IMO.\nLRIT involves four major themes:\na. 	Maritime Security: To ensure Contracting Governments (CGs) are aware of SOLAS-class vessels transiting within 1,000NM off their coastlines or intending to enter their ports;\nb. 	Safety of Shipping: To enhance Canadian SOLAS-class Flag coverage;\nc. 	Search and Rescue: To enhance SAR services; and\nd.	Environmental Response:  To enhance the ability to track and identify SOLAS-class vessels who may be involved in an environmental response incident.     \n\nNew LRIT carriage requirements reflect the international requirements adopted by the IMO for the carriage of LRIT equipment on board SOLAS-class vessels.  \n\nScope of Work:\nIn Summary, the Contractor is required for the Design, Implementation and Testing of the products, services, training and functionalities of a Canadian Long Range Identification and Tracking LRIT National Data Centre (NDC) Service, including a Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) service and a Security Screening solution.\n\nComprehensive Land Claims Agreements\nN/A\n\nOwnership of Intellectual Property:\nN/A\n\nSecurity Requirement:\nThere is no security requirement associated with this Solicitation, but there are security requirements indicated in Part 7 - RESULTING CONTRACT CLAUSES.\n\nPeriod of the Contract:\nThe period of the Contract is from date of Contract to twelve (12 months) thereafter.\nThe expected period of the Contract is from September 1st 2024 to August 31st 2025.\n\nTrade Agreements:\nThe requirement is subject to the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA), World Trade Organization-Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP), Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA), Canada - Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA), Canada - European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).\n\nContracting Authority :\nName: Juan Villasana\nPhone Number: 343 597 5129\nEmail Address: DFO.tenders-soumissions.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n\nInquiries:\nInquiries regarding this RFSO requirement must be submitted to the Standing offering Authority named above.

This workshop will assist industry in understanding Defence Materiel Sustainment (formerly: the Sustainment Initiative) and its strategic context, the SBCA process, industry’s role in supporting the SBCA process, and gaining insight into how materiel sustainment and SBCA may affect the delivery of sustainment solutions for military equipment.\n\nSchedule:\nDates	                                        Time\nMonday, 16 September 2024	8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (EDT)\nTuesday, 19 November 2024	8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (EST)\n\nWhat is a SBCA: The SBCA is a rigorous analytical process that guides sustainment teams in developing flexible, scalable, and principles-based sustainment solutions. The analysis framework of SBCA relies on a whole-of-government approach with early industry engagement. It results in both improved decision making, and the development of integrated sustainment solutions that are optimized based on the four principles of sustainment: performance, value for money, flexibility, and socio-economic benefits. The SBCA is designed to assess/evaluate all relevant options contributing to the development of tailored sustainment solutions for military equipment. \n\nWhy is this important: The SBCA guides the development of sustainment solutions and the resulting procurement of equipment support services. Combined with preliminary SBCA option analyses, these enable Canada to meaningfully engage with industry, early in the procurement process. This facilitates forthright discussions on commercial sustainment considerations, opportunities for innovation and mutual risk reduction, the strengths of industry members, and more. Early engagement provides industry with additional time to craft sustainment solutions that closely align with client requirements. The early establishment and discussion of outcomes, underpins Canada’s ability to integrate performance measures, payment, incentives and results, to achieve optimal sustainment outcomes, as per the four sustainment principles (performance, value for money, flexibility and socio-economic benefits). \n\nAbout these Workshops: Unless otherwise noted, the workshops will be delivered in English, via Microsoft Teams, for which an invitation and applicable details will be provided 1 - 2 weeks before the scheduled workshop date. A copy of the workshop presentation slides will be provided. Workshops are conducted in an informal atmosphere that provides for questions and discussion. Please Note: While every effort is made to address participant concerns and discuss issues of mutual interest, SBCA workshops do not address specific SBCA files or procurements.\n\nRegistration: To register, please send an email to TPSGC.PASoutiendelaDefense-APDefenceSustainment.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca, providing your name, email address (for confirmation of registration and distribution of the workshop materials), your company name and your position. Please register no later than two weeks prior to the workshop. \n\nQuestions or concerns may be directed to TPSGC.PASoutiendelaDefense-APDefenceSustainment.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca.\n\nLink to previously canceled Request For Information: https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/tender-opportunities/tender-notice/pw-22-00994062\n"

This will help us better track and report on what contracts are being used for, as well as the overall cost of our programs. \n\nPSPC will be asking vendors to provide proof that resources being put forward for work on specific contracts have given their permission to do so.\n\nIn the coming weeks, federal departments and agencies will also be validating the accuracy of resumes and may ask vendors for supporting documentation. \n\nWe will be requiring vendors to disclose all sub-contracts on new solicitations.\n\nFinally, we are working to increase the number of solutions-based contracts, relative to task-based contracts. \n\nChanges to future Requests for Proposal (RFP)\n\nFor all new RFPs related to these supply arrangements, PSPC will no longer rely on the resumes or proposed resources as the basis of selection. Moving forward, bid evaluations will focus on other criteria, such as:\n\n•	demonstrated past ability of a vendor to perform similar work, and \n•	ability to commit to Canada’s socio-economic objectives.\n\nWe will also require vendors to provide more detailed cost information in their bids, including breakdowns of direct and indirect cost, as well as projected profit. The Government of Canada will treat this information as commercially sensitive, similar to other third-party information gathered through the contracting process.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThese changes will be gradually implemented in the coming weeks. Vendors are encouraged to get in touch with their Contracting Authority at PSPC for more information about existing contracts and forthcoming procurements.\n\nWe will also make information about new procedures available online, and will continue to share information with the vendor community as it becomes available.\n\nIf you have any questions, please submit them via email to tpsgc.sspc-cpss.pwgsc@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca .\nThank you for your ongoing cooperation."

It functions as the UNFCCC’s supreme decision-making body and a broader UN climate change conference. COPs bring together up to 50,000+ participants from around the world through several streams of engagement and discussion:\n\n•	Technical negotiations: country delegates advancing technical work in the various areas of the UNFCCC’s mandate, including advancing the implementation of the Paris Agreement. \n•	High Ministerial dialogues and events: political leaders strategically engaging to advance global efforts on climate change.\n•	Official side events and exhibits: parallel thematic discussions, events and pavilions showcasing climate action and technologies, including by representatives of business, civil society, sub-national governments, Indigenous peoples, and others. \n\nCOP29 will be hosted by Azerbaijan, in Baku, from November 11 to 22, 2024. While Azerbaijan has yet to formally outline details concerning the event, national pavilions will again be a prominent feature of COP29.  Pavilions are physical high-visibility spaces within the COP that can help advance a country’s priorities by providing a hub for networking and engaging with stakeholders, a space for hosting events with partners and a ready-made venue for showcasing and promoting Canada on the world stage. \n\nCanada intends to divide its pavilion space to serve two key functions:\n\n1.	A space for gathering and networking, where officials, partners, stakeholders, and delegates from around the world can gather to interact and learn more about Canadian climate initiatives.\n2.	A space to host events where the Government of Canada, subnational governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Canada’s domestic and international stakeholders can host short events dedicated to profiling specific climate change initiatives and themes to an in-person audience of up to 40 people.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is seeking the services of an Event Management Team (EMT) to assist with creation and hosting of a COP29 pavilion website, the gathering of event proposals, the creation of the event program, and assist with the logistical coordination (e.g., room set-up) and execution of the events on site (e.g., changes to schedule), which will take place at Canada’s national pavilion at COP29.
